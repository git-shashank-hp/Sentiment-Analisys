# 🎵 Sentiment Analysis Classifier with Machine Learning Models

Welcome to this mini project focused on sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews for musical instruments! As someone passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP), I believe that sentiment analysis can greatly influence business development. By analyzing sentiments in customer reviews, businesses can gain crucial insights into customer perceptions and preferences. This, in turn, can drive strategic decisions and enhance customer satisfaction.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this project, we performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset better. EDA involved examining data distributions, identifying patterns, and preparing the data for modeling.

## 🧩 Models Used

We tested several classification models to train and test our dataset:

- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** 🏆
- **Decision Tree Classifier** 🌳
- **Logistic Regression** 📉
- **Random Forest Classifier** 🌲
- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** 🧑‍🔬
- **K-Neighbors Classifier** 🤝

Happy analyzing! 🚀
